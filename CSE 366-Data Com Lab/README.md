# 📡 CSE366 - Communication Engineering Lab Project

This repository contains simulation programs developed for the **Communication Engineering Lab (CSE 366)** at **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)**, under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

## 📘 Course Overview

The lab focuses on understanding and implementing key concepts of analog and digital communication through simulation and coding exercises. This repository includes six key simulations corresponding to the course syllabus.

## 🔧 Features & Implemented Programs

### ✅ 1. Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
- Simulates analog-to-digital signal conversion.
- Implements sampling, quantization, and encoding.

### ✅ 2. Digital-to-Digital Conversion
- Line coding and decoding techniques.
- Block coding and decoding schemes.

### ✅ 3. Digital-to-Analog Conversion
- Simulations for:
  - Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
  - Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
  - Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

### ✅ 4. Additional Line Coding Techniques
- NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)
- NRZ-L (Level)
- Manchester Encoding
- Differential Manchester Encoding

### ✅ 5. Block Even Parity Error Detection
- Implements a `4 x 8` block parity-based error detection system.

### ✅ 6. CRC Error Detection
- Implements **Cyclic Redundancy Check** for detecting errors in transmitted digital data.
