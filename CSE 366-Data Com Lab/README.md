# 📡 CSE 366 - Data Communication Lab

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook implementations for the **CSE 366: Data Communication Lab** at **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)**, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

The following tasks cover essential concepts in data communication, ranging from signal encoding to error detection. Each task is implemented in a dedicated `.ipynb` notebook.

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Task_1.ipynb** | Pulse Code Modulation (PCM): Simulates analog-to-digital conversion including sampling, quantization, and encoding. |
| **Task_2.ipynb** | Digital-to-Digital Conversion: Implements line coding and block coding schemes. |
| **Task_3.ipynb** | Digital-to-Analog Conversion: Simulates ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation techniques. |
| **Task_4.ipynb** | Line Coding Techniques: NRZ, NRZ-L, Manchester, and Differential Manchester encoding. |
| **Task_5.ipynb** | 4×8 Block Even Parity Error Detection. |
| **Task_6.ipynb** | CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Error Detection Model. |
| **Task_7.ipynb** | Additional or bonus implementation (optional/custom content depending on your submission). |
