## 🔍 Lab Descriptions

### ✅ Lab #01: N-Queens Problem
Place **N queens** on an **N×N chessboard** so that no two queens threaten each other (no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

### ✅ Lab #02: 8-Puzzle Problem
Solve the classic **8-puzzle** using a search algorithm to transform any given initial state into the goal state by moving the blank tile.

### ✅ Lab #03: Water Jug Problem
Given two jugs with capacities **3 liters** and **4 liters**, use a series of operations to measure **exactly 2 liters** of water.

Operations allowed:
- Fill a jug
- Empty a jug
- Pour water from one jug to another

### ✅ Lab #04: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Implement the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to traverse or search tree/graph data structures.

### ✅ Lab #05: Depth-First Search (DFS)
Implement the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for graph or tree traversal.

### ✅ Lab #06: Missionaries and Cannibals Problem
Solve the classic **Missionaries and Cannibals** problem using search and state representation.

### ✅ Lab #07: Sudoku Solver
Build a **Sudoku solver** using a backtracking algorithm to fill a 9x9 grid so that each row, column, and subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9.
